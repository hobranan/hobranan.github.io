							<h2>Learning from a Project Management Workshop</h2>
							<p>TAGS: project management </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>The UofA Engineering Students’ Society was sponsoring a project management workshop,
							presented by coRoc Solutions, so I figured it would be a good learning session to aid my
							professional career.

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						Some of the information was tailored around profiling personalizations so as to better work with
						the people who fit those personalities, but I was more interested in what project management
						tools we could use. The workshop provided a word template for a general project management
						charter, but also mentioned other software tools:<br>
						- ClickUp: an online project management tool, which I believe is good for analysing task
						statistics for a given project. (free? Freemium?)<br>
						- Microsoft Project: I believe this is a basic tool, it has Gantt chart abilities, but not sure
						of its limits or cost. (not free?)<br>
						- Rocketlane: Recommended by a guest speaker of the workshop, it is apparently a simple project
						management that is full of tools and templates. (free trial only?)<br>
						- Azure DevOps (GitHub DevOps): Apparently quite good for software developers (like me) since
						they contain tools for them, like pipelines, repos, planning boards; I’ve use plain GitHub for
						its project board, wiki, and Actions, so I’m not sure how Azure is much different from it.<br><br>

						The workshop also made me consider past university courses taken that emphasize the use of
						requirements documents, vision documents, stakeholder considerations, and weekly reports; (along
						with the previously mentioned GitHub project tools); and safety related considerations like
						management of change process and risk matrices (tasks measured with ‘probabilities vs
						consequences’). Also, it made me think of a past work role that used the Operations Integrity
						Management System (OIMS) (by Imperial Oil), which is like a project management system but on a
						large company size scale; it is a very detailed tool that can lay out considerations for many
						aspects of running an operation safely (see the References link for details of the OIMS 11-part
						system).<br><br>

						During the workshop we went through a couple scenarios that detailed the layout of the project
						management template provided. I have linked that here:<br>
