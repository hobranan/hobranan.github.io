						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p> After my first year of engineering, I was asked by my MacEwan University teacher, Dr. Davis,
							if I wanted to participate in an Undergraduate Student Research Initiative (USRI) study. The
							study was centered around researching if augmented reality tools could aid in a student’s
							learning.<br>

							I wanted to participate mostly because it was an opportunity to learn the Unity game engine
							(which I have never used before, but heard it was great for developing games and
							simulations). In this study I researched what other articles focused on AR for pedagogical
							use and if I could develop scenes in Unity (and Fusion 360 for drawing) that reflected
							engineering course concepts that could be better explained with AR model scenes.

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p><b>Parts:</b> Unity; Fusion 360 (if you need to make models); smartphone</p>
						<p>
							I made a summary video on YouTube that showcases what Unity scene’s I was developing and
							what engineering course branches (Mechanics, Computer) they were fixed on. The video
							description also has details for the project and each scene. In Unity, I used an AR library
							called EasyAR because my phone didn’t have the depth-AR capabilities that other AR libraries
							needed.<br>

							YouTube link (apologies for the shakiness; I was holding the camera by hand trying to
							record, and keep the background aligned, and activate buttons/bars): <br>

							Another version (I tired to stabilize the shakiness of the first video, but it made other
							items shaky):<br>

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>Unity is a pretty cool simulation tool.</b> This was my first experience with the basics of
						Unity (layout, folder placement, tool locations) and its pretty nice to use. This was also my
						first real coding experience, and I did not find that too overwhelming; I coded scripts in C#
						(all animations, except the Valve one, were created through coding writing, like rotations, UI
						buttons, colour manipulations).<br>
						<b>I gained an understanding of an immediate use of AR in 3D modeling.</b> So far, a prime use
						of AR is
						to take computer model prototypes and visualize their placement in the real world without
						physically creating an expensive time consuming model with immediate changes/regrets to that
						model; e.g. placing a AR-model of a complex engine in a real-world empty corner, and immediately
						realizing that currently installed fuel supply lines, from the real-world, would approach the
						AR-engine's fuel injection points at an impractical location/angle, quickly making me realize
						that "I should have modeled the engine's fuel lines on the other side", but I didn't build the
						engine yet, so I could easily change the 3D model without causing money-losing regrets.
