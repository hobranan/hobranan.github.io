						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>I wanted to test a free IOT server service that allows me to monitor my microcontroller
							sensors from the web (from my smartphone). I had previously tested the Cayenne service,
							which was ok but seemed to not display well on my smartphone. Now I’m testing the
							AdafruitIO
							IOT server service. It, like Cayenne, can allows a user to add arduinos, esp devices,
							but
							seems to only allow raspberry pi picos (their ‘arduino nano’ microcontroller version of
							raspberry pi) to its service; this is probably because they are a microcontroller
							service
							and not focused on microprocessors, but I’m speculating on that.

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>I wanted to test a free IOT server service that allows me to monitor my microcontroller
							sensors from the web (from my smartphone). I had previously tested the Cayenne service,
							which was ok but seemed to not display well on my smartphone. Now I’m testing the
							AdafruitIO
							IOT server service. It, like Cayenne, can allows a user to add arduinos, esp devices,
							but
							seems to only allow raspberry pi picos (their ‘arduino nano’ microcontroller version of
							raspberry pi) to its service; this is probably because they are a microcontroller
							service
							and not focused on microprocessors, but I’m speculating on that.

							<h2>My Experience With Using Unity To Develop Scenes In UAlberta's AR App</h2>
							<p>TAGS: software; Unity; University of Alberta; Augmented Reality; smartphone; programming </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p> I had the opportunity to work with some fine people on the University of Alberta’s
							Augmented Reality app called “UAlberta AR”. The app showcases many engineering course
							concepts that students and teachers can use as an aid in visualizing/ experiencing said
							concepts. It was a great experience to develop my Unity skills but also develop team
							collaborations skills especially with DevOp style git version control (we had our project on
							a git repo and used Unity’s Continuous Integration checker to check our updates everything we made a revision to
							the app). We also followed a sprint team review style when setting project goals.
						</p>

						<span class="image featured"><img

						<div class="center">
							<p><i>UAlberta AR: an app for showcasing engineering course concepts.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							I made quite a few scenes, but I uploaded to YouTube a showcase video of three scenes I
							particularly liked: <br> 
							<a href="https://youtu.be/-mmq2LekMbI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/-mmq2LekMbI</a> <br>
							The video description details more about the project and scenes.

						<div class="center">
							<p><i>One of the scenes: seeing the internal workings of a 5-speed transmission.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>It was a great experience!</b> I got to develop my
						Unity skills and collaborate with other teammates on their Unity skills. I learned more about
						the sprint work style. I got to see how Unity does continuous integration. I learned more
						engineering concepts while I developed the simulations for them.

							<h2>My First Unity Experience While Doing A Pedagogical Research Study</h2>
							<p>TAGS: software; Unity; research; pedagogy; Augmented Reality; Undergraduate Student
								Research Initiative (USRI); Fusion 360; programming </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p> After my first year of engineering, I was asked by my MacEwan University teacher, Dr. Davis,
							if I wanted to participate in an Undergraduate Student Research Initiative (USRI) study. The
							study was centered around researching if augmented reality tools could aid in a student’s
							learning.<br>

							I wanted to participate mostly because it was an opportunity to learn the Unity game engine
							(which I have never used before, but heard it was great for developing games and
							simulations). In this study I researched what other articles focused on AR for pedagogical
							use and if I could develop scenes in Unity (and Fusion 360 for drawing) that reflected
							engineering course concepts that could be better explained with AR model scenes.

						</p>

						<span class="image featured"><img
								src="articleAssets\Unity-AR-Pedogogical-Research-Study\Unity-AR-Pedogogical_2.jpg"
								alt="" /></span>
						<div class="center">
							<p><i>My first project experience using Unity;<br>Studying the pedagogical uses of AR when
									learning engineering course concepts.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							I made a summary video on YouTube that showcases what Unity scene’s I was developing and
							what engineering course branches (Mechanics, Computer) they were fixed on. The video
							description also has details for the project and each scene. In Unity, I used an AR library
							called EasyAR because my phone didn’t have the depth-AR capabilities that other AR libraries
							needed.<br>

							YouTube link (apologies for the shakiness; I was holding the camera by hand trying to
							record, and keep the background aligned, and activate buttons/bars): <br>
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aArtjM2tWk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aArtjM2tWk</a> <br>

							items shaky):<br>

						<div class="center">
							<p><i>One of the scenes: visualizing momentum factors, with curling rocks.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						<b>Unity is a pretty cool simulation tool.</b> This was my first experience with the basics of
						Unity (layout, folder placement, tool locations) and its pretty nice to use. This was also my
						first real coding experience, and I did not find that too overwhelming; I coded scripts in C#
						(all animations, except the Valve one, were created through coding writing, like rotations, UI
						buttons, colour manipulations).<br>
						<b>I gained an understanding of an immediate use of AR in 3D modeling.</b> So far, a prime use
						of AR is
						to take computer model prototypes and visualize their placement in the real world without
						physically creating an expensive time consuming model with immediate changes/regrets to that
						model; e.g. placing a AR-model of a complex engine in a real-world empty corner, and immediately
						realizing that currently installed fuel supply lines, from the real-world, would approach the
						AR-engine's fuel injection points at an impractical location/angle, quickly making me realize
						that "I should have modeled the engine's fuel lines on the other side", but I didn't build the
						engine yet, so I could easily change the 3D model without causing money-losing regrets.
