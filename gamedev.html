									An IOT Sensor Monitor</a></h2>
							<p>TAGS: electronics; software; Esp8266; Arduino; WIFI Web Server; AdafruitIO </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>I wanted to test a free IOT server service that allows me to monitor my microcontroller
							sensors from the web (from my smartphone). I had previously tested the Cayenne service,
							which was ok but seemed to not display well on my smartphone. Now I’m testing the
							AdafruitIO
							IOT server service. It, like Cayenne, can allows a user to add arduinos, esp devices,
							but
							seems to only allow raspberry pi picos (their ‘arduino nano’ microcontroller version of
							raspberry pi) to its service; this is probably because they are a microcontroller
							service
							and not focused on microprocessors, but I’m speculating on that.

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						<b>It works well but has limits.</b> I’m able to see all of the data on the
						AdafruitIO website (including historical charts) and I can have multiple dashboards setup so
						that the same feed data can go to different views, but I’m only allowed 10 sensor data pieces
						for my free account, so this isn’t a viable solution if I need a free option and many sensors.

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							Wanted to experience the impressive long-range (LoRa) abilities of the TTGO esp32 LoRa
							technology.
							I figured a perfect use for pair of these is a messaging network that doesn’t use cellular
							nor WAN-wifi service
							(like if I’m hiking in deep woods); I would program the LoRa esps to each pair with separate
							smartphones
							(via wifi access points or Bluetooth), then use the LoRas to communicate with each other
							over long distance;
							The smartphones could then send messages to each other through their LoRa counterparts. <br>
							But… it turns out someone already made that!<br>
							The Meshtastic project is an open-source project design to build mesh communication networks
							using low powered devices.

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							It was the project of one of my engineering courses where the focus was to learn some
							Arduino electronics building
							and to learn how to brainstorm and report projects (for imaginary customers). We were tasked
							with building a wind
							speed sensor (turbine) using a rotary encoder and Arduino, plus 2 additional sensors of our
							choice. I was able to
							build on my Fusion 360 3D modeling and printing skills by printing some wind blades and
							housings. Finally, we had
							to summarize our project into a report PDF.

							<p>TAGS: electronics; software; website; webserver; ESP8266; Arduino </p>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							I wanted to see if I could monitor and control a small microcontroller from a privately
							owned web server and website that is hosted on that same microcontroller.<br>

							One of the beauties of having Wi-Fi on a tiny microcontroller is that you can monitor and
							control the sensors from a separate smartphone or computer display (so no need to hook up an
							LCD, and you get to view the information remotely). Another cool thing is that some smart
							developers created libraries for the Arduino/Esp compatible microcontrollers that allow a
							person to host html code so you can view it from the web.

							Cloud based web servers aren’t free (for the most part; you can get an exception to this by
							using GitHub Pages, but apparently the level of service is limited); the costs arise from
							the power and service time allocated from companies to have their computers serve the cloud
							requests (think of it like charging for virtual parking and virtual valets of your website
							or other internet services). To get around this (at least at the individual tinkerers’
							level) you can host your own website on your own hardware.

							<p>TAGS: software; website; GitHub Pages; Namecheap; Html5up; Unsplash </p>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>I wanted to understand more about the basics of building and hosting a website; this
							included: html files that are the bones of the website (provided for free by Html5up),
							optional free photos from Unsplash, an optional domain name (for $6 to $13 from
							Namecheap),
							and from web hosting service from GitHub Pages.<br>

							Many popular website builder’s (like Squarespace, Wix and Wordpress) are good at setting
							up
							nice looking, fast generated websites, but they require a monthly service fee for
							hosting
							it. Typical website fees stem from: holding a domain name (like ‘myexample.com’) for a
							yearly fee of ~$13; using web hosting servers (like Wordpress or HostPapa) for a monthly
							fee
							of ~$2; HTML theme files for free or ~$55 for fancy ones.<br>

							The website building method I chose can get you all elements you need to host your own
							website for free (but I spent the extra few dollars to get a nice domain name instead of
							'username.github.io’). Note that GitHub Pages is a static website, which means it’s
							primary
							usage it to display consistent content regardless of user (while dynamic websites can
							display content dynamically for different user profiles, like Netflix). For me right
							now,
							GitHub Pages is fine.

									Embedded Systems Concepts
									With Arduino And FreeRTOS</a></h2>
							<p>TAGS: electronics; software; FreeRTOS; Arduino; nano; stepper motor; UART; </p>
						</header>
						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							In one of my university’s courses, we learned about real-time embedded systems.
							Real-time
							operating systems are systems that strive to complete tasks within hard time limits;
							these
							can be both scheduled and interrupt triggered tasks. They are important systems
							because not
							only do they express high performance with their ability to respond, but they are
							suitable
							for mission or safety critical systems (like vehicle accident black boxes, aircraft
							systems,
							medical devices).<br>
							FreeRTOS is an example of a real-time operating system (it’s in the name). I learned
							that
							you could import the FreeRTOS library on the Arduino IDE, so I wanted to reflect on
							the
							concepts in learned in my course and how I could apply them to an Arduino
							project.<br>
							The main concepts our course focused on were: multi-tasking/concurrency and
							priorities;
							queue containers; UART and SPI communications; device control (motors with
							opto-isolator,
							displays, buttons, leds); hardware interrupts and polling;

							- Organization designations for allowing other team members to separately interact

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p> After my first year of engineering, I was asked by my MacEwan University teacher,

							student’s
							learning.<br>

							I wanted to participate mostly because it was an opportunity to learn the Unity game
							engine
							(which I have never used before, but heard it was great for developing games and
							simulations). In this study I researched what other articles focused on AR for
							pedagogical
							use and if I could develop scenes in Unity (and Fusion 360 for drawing) that
							reflected
							engineering course concepts that could be better explained with AR model scenes.

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							For our Requirements Engineering course at university, we went through the process of how to
							make a Vision document and a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for imaginary app
							ideas that other lab groups had made up. For my team, we chose to act as the software
							contractors for an interactive map app of the UAlberta campus. This app would connect with
							the user’s university schedule and provide suggested walking routes between its classes. It
							would be tailored to incorporate construction, path/elevator outages, or high traffic
							(similar to how Google Maps works for construction).<br><br>
							The course’s project was designed to incorporate software requirements concepts and give us
							an idea of how to interact with customers on getting their requirements for a software
							product. While it was a great project for understanding those concepts, it was also an
							opportunity to use Figma for the prototyping part of the software development presentation.
							At the end of the project timeline, we were to present to our ‘clients’ a prototype of the
							product (typically as a picture walkthrough), but I knew about Figma from previous use
							during a UI/UX hackathon, so I wanted to use it for this project.
