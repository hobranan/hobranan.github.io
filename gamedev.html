							<h2>Practicing Unity 2.5D game development with a 'Tanks' game template.
							</h2>
							<p>TAGS: software; Unity; programming; audio </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>One of Unity’s lessons involved a 2-player tank battling game in 3D environment overtop a 2D
							mechanic space (creating this 2.5D like environment). I was intrigue by that environment,
							but not the 2-player mechanics of it. Instead, I wanted to practice my Unity skills by
							turning the 2-player battle game into a 1-player vs computer battle game.<br><br>

							Here I made a short level where the player (a green tank) must traverse and destroy all
							enemy tanks and buildings without getting killed. It demoes: object instantiation and
							destruction, life bars, SFX and music (my own track), simple UI layout (just words on a
							canvas with keyboard controls), win/lose triggers.<br><br>

							This is a demo video of me going through the level:
						</p>

						</p>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						The demo allowed me to try win/lose triggers for the scene overtop simple UIs, and allowed me to
						create modified fabrications of different enemy tanks (with different behaviours).<br>
						I didn’t bother with the original demo’s 2-player system because I feel like most multiplayers
						on not on same computer (and I wanted the interactivity of automatic enemies), so I would like
						to later try learning demos of online multiplayer setups.<br>
						I got to be immersed into gameplay while listening to my audio track and it gave me perspective
						on how well the track fits with the scene: I felt the music was gelling well with the scene, but
						some parts I felt were overly distracting.

							<h2>Trying 'FMOD', a recognized substitute application for Unity's audio mixer.</h2>
							<p>TAGS: FMOD audio engine; audio; Unity </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>While exploring audio engineering services that work with Unity, I frequently noticed FMOD
							being mentioned. FMOD is freemium (free but up to a certain revenue level, like Unity)
							gaming sound engine/API that can easily hook into Unity. It was used by some notably famous
							games, some like: BioShock, Dark Souls, Minecraft.<br><br>

							I wanted to see what it has to offer that may compare to the standard Unity audio
							tools.<br><br>

							Here I demonstrated a notable feature of Fmod: the visual parametrization of a SFX group
							which allows me to combine, speed up, and trigger
							different motor sounds to create a variable go-kart engine noises based on variable input
							velocity.
						</p>

							</iframe>
						</div>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						I think FMOD may be useful, but there is a learning curve needed and the basic Unity
						audio tools
						(especially with the newer editor version) seem to do most of what FMOD can do (I
						think, I
						haven’t explored the entirety of FMOD; there might be crucial/quality features that
						FMOD has,
						that Unity doesn’t); while the visual parametrization (that FMOD was demoed with)
						seems useful,
						it can be substituted with in-depth audio scripting (i.e. precise code that mimics
						parametrization).

							<h2>Trying 'Fadr' service to split music files into stems and MIDI files.</h2>
							<p>TAGS: Fadr; audio; Maschine </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>Stem files are a group of music tracks that were split from an original track into their
							separate fields (of instrumentals and vocals). Previous delves into MIDI files have shown me
							how to manipulate a tune’s sequence to remix it with different instruments or modified
							sequences. Stems can manipulate tracks by dividing them into respective zones allowing me to
							remix parts of the track, while leaving the rest intact or moving those parts to different
							tracks altogether.<br><br>

							The Fadr website allows me to freely (at a basic level) create stems and MIDIs from upload
							tracks. My Maschine software can easily import stems (in the form of WAV files), along with
							MIDIs, to experiment with different combinations of instruments to remix tracks.<br><br>

							Unity includes an upbeat track for the ‘Karting’ microgame that I decide to remix using its
							stems and MIDIs. (note: these tunes are NOT for commercial use, they are just educational
							demos).<br><br>

							Original tune is the first half of this track, while the remix is the last half; here I
							replaced the piano tunes with rock and bass guitar tunes, while keeping the drums same
							throughout:
						</p>

							<source src="https://docs.google.com/uc?export=open&id=1df0AfaFy6ev_LW7hXRgtgRGtmY9lcI35"
								type="audio/wav">
						</audio> 

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						As demoed, stems (along with MIDIs) can further extend the remixing abilities of a song.
						Furthermore, if I no longer have the original Maschine editor files for a track (which
						distinctively list all instruments and sequences separately), I can use this service to easily
						cut
						old copies of my WAV or MP3 songs. The Fadr service is free for basic level stem cutting, and
						requires a subscription to get enhanced cutting (a further precise stem making operation), so it
						would be nice to find a free alternative service that does that too.

							<h2>Experimenting with MIDI file generations to remix songs.</h2>
							<p>TAGS: software; audio; Maschine </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files are the data forms of music composition
							sequences, so they can be very useful for modifying in order to create remixes of
							scores.<br><br>

							My Maschine software can easily import MIDIs to autofill the editor with sequences, and I
							can then experiment with different instruments to play them or modify the sequences to
							change the tune.<br><br>

							Given that I am a fan of the Zelda game series, I used MIDI files from “A Link to the Past”
							(awesome classic game), to modify the instruments and notes to remix those tunes. (note:
							these tunes are NOT for commercial use, they are just educational demos).<br><br>

								type="audio/wav">
						</audio>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						As demoed, MIDI files can be extremely useful for remixing tunes; I would find this extremely
						useful if making a series of games (or even just levels) that have a thematic tune that slowly
						evolves; like this Link To the Past ‘exploring’ tune was actually remixed from the original NES
						Zelda game.<br>
						Aside from nostalgia, these tracks can be inspirational when they are assigned different
						instruments with different effects; I wasn’t expecting to be feeling a spooky environment when
						playing the ‘exploring’ MIDI on different instruments.

							<h2>Completing Electronic Arts' Software Engineering Experience Simulation</h2>
							<p>TAGS: software; Electronic Arts; Forage; programming </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>I saw this program advertised on EA’s website, so I wanted to explore what developers do
							there. It was free, self paced, and could have increased my skill profile, so it seemed
							worthwhile to explore.<br>

							In the program I was tasked to:
							- Create a new feature for the ‘Sims 4’ game and present it in the form of a written
							proposal. (I went with an Aeroponics tower item for the Sims garden area).<br>
							- Develop a UML class diagram of the object-oriented layout of the previously mentioned
							features.<br>
							- Code a C++ header file (function declaration file) of the previously mentioned
							features.<br>
							- Fix code bugs by analyzing an assignment C++ file and changing it. (It was mostly around
							changing variable and method data types to ones that were more flexible and future proof).

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						I already knew about these given tasks from my university Computer Engineering schooling, but it
						was still useful to get insight into how EA does things (though I think these 4 tasks are a
						‘drop in a bucket’ of what an EA software engineer does; I would have like this experience to
						have had more tasks); I rarely used C++, so it was nice to get more experience with that.

							<h2>Using audio scripting to parameterize sound effects.</h2>
							<p>TAGS: Unity; programming; audio </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>Playing/triggering sound effects and music in a static setting is usually good enough for
							simple game scenes, but there are times where customization of audio improves the quality of
							a scene.

							I went through a Unity demo where I was able to combine multiple sound effects with a code
							script that parameterizes a projectile’s force intensity to output different sound effects
							of different intensities. <br><br>Here we have a small demo of a projectile launcher firing
							against a
							stack of cubes; higher force collisions produce strong crashing noises, while weaker ones
							produce weak crumbling noises; it creates an overall effect of a building toppling with loud
							noises that trails/ends to weaker noises:
						</p>

								style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen>
							</iframe>
						</div>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						As said before, this can be unnecessary for simple games, but it also show just how little
						scripting effort is needed to make higher quality scenes.<br>I imagine putting these algorithmic
						techniques on enemies so that when I hit them with different force intensities, they can react
						with different intensities (all without individually assigning noises to individual
						enemies).

							<h2>Exploring top-down 2D tile development in Unity.</h2>
							<p>TAGS: Unity; programming </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>Unity has dedicated tools for 2D development. These include tilemap and spritemap tools that
							make it easy to paint a scene with a 2D environment.<br><br>
							I practice with these tools to create a top-down 2D environment as a starter simulation for
							my UAlberta student club Renewable Energy Design (RED) (I’m not making anything for that
							club, I’m just using it as a simulation inspiration for 2D development).

						</p>


						<span class="image featured"><img
								src="articleAssets\gamedev\2dtilemapping.jpg" alt="" />
						</span>


						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p>
							I’m still learning, but so far the 2D tile-mapping feature is very easy. I wonder if I can
							apply previous lessons about procedural content generation (from my previously taken
							CMPUT256 course and other internet resources) to create scripts that will generate new
							levels automatically.

							<h2>Reflecting on Unity's Foundations of Audio to practice spatial audio tools</h2>
							<p>TAGS: software; Unity; programming; audio </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>Unity has many tutorials around audio tools but they are in most case just audio file
							assignment.<br>

							Some of the more dynamic tools Unity has are the 3D audio tools which allow for:<br>
							-Listeners and emitters (player and sound sources).<br>
							-Spatial distance audio intensity (the further away a sound is, the quieter it is).<br>
							-Doppler effect (as a sound move towards you it is higher pitched, and vice versa).<br>
							-Reverb zones (audio sources gain effects when they are in marked zones).<br>
							I demoed these effects on a Monster growling scene asset (whcih shows the SFX tools) and Viking village scene asset where the player ‘listener’ (a rock)
							was moving near fire sources embedded with spatial flames sounds and siren doppler sounds,
							and a building producing 'hall' audio effects (reverb zones).

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p> I had the opportunity to work with some fine people on the University of Alberta's
							Augmented Reality app called “UAlberta AR”. The app showcases many engineering course
							concepts that students and teachers can use as an aid in visualizing/ experiencing said
							concepts. It was a great experience to develop my Unity skills but also develop team
							collaborations skills especially with DevOp style git version control (we had our project on
							a git repo and used Unity's Continuous Integration checker to check our updates everything
							we made a revision to
							the app). We also followed a sprint team review style when setting project goals.

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>It was a great experience!</b> I got to develop my
						Unity skills and collaborate with other teammates on their Unity skills. I learned more about
						the sprint work style. I got to see how Unity does continuous integration. I learned more
						engineering concepts while I developed the simulations for them.

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p> After my first year of engineering, I was asked by my MacEwan University teacher, Dr. Davis,
							if I wanted to participate in an Undergraduate Student Research Initiative (USRI) study. The
							study was centered around researching if augmented reality tools could aid in a student's
							learning.<br>

							I wanted to participate mostly because it was an opportunity to learn the Unity game engine
							(which I have never used before, but heard it was great for developing games and
							simulations). In this study I researched what other articles focused on AR for pedagogical
							use and if I could develop scenes in Unity (and Fusion 360 for drawing) that reflected
							engineering course concepts that could be better explained with AR model scenes.

						</p>

						<p>
							I made a summary video on YouTube that showcases what Unity scene's I was developing and
							what engineering course branches (Mechanics, Computer) they were fixed on. The video
							description also has details for the project and each scene. In Unity, I used an AR library
							called EasyAR because my phone didn't have the depth-AR capabilities that other AR libraries
							needed.<br>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						<b>Unity is a pretty cool simulation tool.</b> This was my first experience with the basics of
						Unity (layout, folder placement, tool locations) and its pretty nice to use. This was also my
						first real coding experience, and I did not find that too overwhelming; I coded scripts in C#
						(all animations, except the Valve one, were created through coding writing, like rotations, UI
						buttons, colour manipulations).<br>
						<b>I gained an understanding of an immediate use of AR in 3D modeling.</b> So far, a prime use
						of AR is
						to take computer model prototypes and visualize their placement in the real world without
						physically creating an expensive time consuming model with immediate changes/regrets to that
						model; e.g. placing a AR-model of a complex engine in a real-world empty corner, and immediately
						realizing that currently installed fuel supply lines, from the real-world, would approach the
						AR-engine's fuel injection points at an impractical location/angle, quickly making me realize
						that "I should have modeled the engine's fuel lines on the other side", but I didn't build the
						engine yet, so I could easily change the 3D model without causing money-losing regrets.
