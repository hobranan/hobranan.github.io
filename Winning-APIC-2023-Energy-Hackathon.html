						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>Hackathons are great place to: brainstorm project ideas; meet other innovators; get some
							recognition and prize money. This hackathon was hosted at my university by the Alberta Power
							Industry Consortium, with the theme being centered around: Safety and Security for the Smart
							Grid, System Modelling and Artificial Intelligence for Power Systems, Grid Integration of
							Renewable and Distributed Energy, and Advanced Power Electronics for the Smart Grid. I love
							electrical-based projects so I figured this hackathon would be great for me.

							<p><i>The title of our chosen topic.<br> We wanted to explore the potential of advancing
									monitoring systems on small energy generation systems.<br> BDJW was our team name.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<!-- <p><b>Parts:</b> plotly software</p> -->

						<p>At the beginning of the hackathon, we were presented with a workshop focused on a neat free
							(for basic use) python platform that can present python data apps over a web server; it was
							call Plotly dash. The workshop demo showed us how to create basic webpage that displayed a
							line chart of API supplied statistical data (if I recall correctly it, was around countries’
							energy production stats); My teammate, Darren, had the fantastic idea of integrating the
							Alberta AESO data (Alberta’s electrical grid historical and current purchase prices) into
							our own web application. Our team further developed the idea to create a web dashboard for
							municipal energy systems (like solar systems, wind farms, etc.) that would act a ‘open’
							proxy dashboard for private systems (since typically private energy systems have their own
							private dashboards to cater to their own private instruments) so that we could monitor that
							systems current outputs/settings, and integrate it with current/historical AESO data to make
							recommendation algorithm for deciding when to keep or sell any produce power back to the
							grid.<br>

							We further thought about how we could expand this algorithm to be smarter (more AI like) by
							capturing historical personal system data, analyzing it with AESO data, to better recommend
							a system’s selling/storing options.<br>

							Given that the hackathon only lasts ~2 days, we developed what we could for the dashboard
							and presented it along with ideas for expansion.<br>

							Our wonderful team presented so beautifully that we won first place for ideas, and first
							place for presentation abilities. Congrats and thank you again to teammates Darren, Jaime,
							and Warren!

						<div class="center">
							<p><i>The app would monitor current energy outputs and use the grid prices and an algorithm
									to determine recommended selling patterns (similar to a stock trading system).<br>
									At the time, it was only the static price differences (between current price and
									desired sell price) used to make recommendations, but we wanted to expand this to
									include
									historical data to make a more dynamic algorithm.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>Is there potential to test?</b> Our university has a Renewable
						Energy Design (RED) student club that houses a solar panel storage system in conjunction with a
						greenhouse and garden. It might be a cool idea to setup this software for that system (even
						though we aren’t hooked up to the Alberta electrical grid) if we can get our panel’s sensors to
						work with it; maybe a raspberry pi might help?
