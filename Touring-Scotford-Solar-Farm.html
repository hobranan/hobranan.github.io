							<h2>Touring Scotford Solar Farm, Canada's largest "behind the meter" solar project.</h2>
							<p>TAGS: nature projects; solar; renewable energy design </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>I'm a member of the UofA student club Renewable Energy Design (RED), and we were invited by
							the Women In Renewable Energey (WIRE) organization to
							tour the Scotford Solar Farm. It was a great opportunity to see a large scale solar farm,
							especially one that is considered the largest "behind the meter" project in Canada; "Behind
							the meter" means that all the generated power goes directly to the Shell Scotford industrial
							site (no grid supplying). Aside from getting the opportunity to see a giant ~58MW solar farm
							(which I
							have not done before), it was also an opportunity to see what challenges and solutions were
							present for such a unique project.</p>

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<!-- <p><b>Parts:</b> plotly software</p> -->

						<p>We weren't allowed to take personal photos so I only have the group one (which includes other
							tour attendees and one of the panels in the background). I won't go into too much detail
							about the project itself, as the references (see bottom of this article) are better
							explainers of it.<br>
							I will note some interesting things I learned from the tour:<br>
							- Many of the 'near panel' wires were actually the typical size of a small/house scale solar
							system (I think ~11AWG); it isn't until they branch together in junction boxes that the
							gauges get larger.<br>
							- The power generated is converted to AC before being sent to the industrial site; there
							were about 10 inverters that could convert 1500VDC to 25000VAC.<br>
							- The panels were mounted on a fixed tilt system (no tracking); they were originally planned
							to have tilt features (which I heard from other research resources would probably increase
							production about 20%; this site seems to agree:
							https://www.polarracking.com/blog/fixed-tilt-vs-single-axis-solar-racking-mounting/ ); they
							scrapped the tilt feature concept because it would require 3x the amount of land to hold the
							mechanical equipment used for tilting.<br>
							- The panels are transparent to allow for additional light capture via reflection; this
							might
							be seen as more beneficial in the winter time when snow is present, which can hopefully
							supplement the panels during that lower sun season.<br>
							- The system has an AI that can detect when the panels are filled with dust or snow,
							indicating of such need for maintenance.<br>
							- The system has numerous solar radiation detectors (they look like clear hlaf-spheres) that
							read the intensity of the sun pointing both down to Earth and up from the ground (for the reflection intensity).
