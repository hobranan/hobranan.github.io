						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>Some of my engineering courses taught me about some fundamental concepts of software
							engineering (through an object-oriented style using the Java language); In doing this, I was
							also guided on how to use Android Studio, a standard application for developing Android
							based apps using the Java language.<br>

							Here I will go over the application my team and I built called QR Hunter, an app for
							translating any QR or bar codes you find with your smartphone camera.

						<div class="center">
							<p><i>Our app has five main features:<br> camera code capture; map navigation; code library
									review; scoreboard review; and profile review.</i>

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p><b>Parts:</b> Android Studio; Google Firebase; Open Street Maps; GitHub; Android smartphone
						</p>

						<p>For our course objectives we were tasked with building an app that basically acts a code
							collection game where you can camera scan any QR/bar code to get uniquely generated
							‘monsters’ with unique names, pictures, and point values (kind of like Pokemon Go); you can
							compare/compete against other players to find the most QR codes, points, or highest code
							values.<br>
							When building the app our software requirements were to build functions that that allows a
							user to:<br>
							- create personal profiles (that I can autologin and log out);<br>
							- see my profile and other’s profiles;<br>
							- add QR and bar codes to that profile via camera;<br>
							- see uniquely generated names, pictures, and points from adding those codes (they are
							determined via inspecting the SHA-256 hash generated from the code’s text values);<br>
							- see pins of other sighted codes on a graphic map (we used Open Street Maps API);<br>
							- comment on yours and other’s codes;<br>
							- search profile codes based on keywords and/or regions;<br>
							- see the score rankings of mine and other’s codes;<br>
							…add other functionality features!<br>

							Stories’:

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>Android Studio is pretty cool.</b> I remember about a year before building this that I tried
						to make an app with Android Studio (not knowing anything about Java) and it was too complicated
						for me. Now, it’s actually quite a handy tool to use (and I find the Java language very
						appetizing compared to the other main ones).<br>
						<b>Google Firebase works great with Java!</b> This project was my introduction to using firebase
						as a
						database (for the profiles and saving any pictures). It is quite handy to use as the
						documentation for setting up push and pull functions are very straightforward. If you know very
						little about database and are going to do something with Java, then I recommend you try it.<br>
						<b>Open Street Maps is a free alternative to Google’s.</b> Since we were on a team testing an
						app that
						could (if programmed incorrectly) make the mistake of constantly pulling map data, we didn’t
						want to risk setting up a paid Google Maps account that would accidently run out of credits over
						a short time. Instead, we used a free map API called Open Street Maps; that was slightly more
						difficult to setup (because of the small amount of documentation) but it worked out in the end;
						use this service if you have the same fear of cost.<br>
						<b>It needs graphics that pop.</b> Even though I’m a fan of the app’s yellow and black color
						scheme of
						the app, it needs some more pop with the colors; it could be updated to be more like Pokemon
						Go’s color palette (for example).<br><br>
