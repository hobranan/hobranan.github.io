								OpenPLC</a></h2>

						</header>
						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							While scouting online for cheap physical PLC options, I found the Canaduino PLC 100 on Amazon.
							It's a small board (about $30) that I had to solder myself and can
							attach to an Arduino Nano. It contains ruggedized inputs and outputs at higher
							voltages than what the Nano natively supplies, like
							6 relay digital outputs with optoisolators; 4 digital inputs that can handle 3.3 - 24V; 4
							analog inputs and 4 analog outputs that can both track in ranges between 0 - 10 V (very
							similar to what many professional PLCs can do);
							onboard LEDs for digital state notification; and 5V and 10V supply lines.<br>
							More importantly, it can be programmed with free Arduino IDE or the free OpenPLC editor and runtime.<br>
							In this video I showcase the board demonstrating its power with a makeshift 'water heater
							and humidifer plant'. </p>

									winning combination for training on and building
									PLCs on a student budget.</a></h2>
							<p>TAGS: electronics; automation; industrial; PLC; OpenPLC; FactoryIO; Modbus
							</p>
						</header>
						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							I'm trying to develop my PLC automation skills as a possible career path, and I'm currently
							a
							student with a student budget.
							PLC programming software can be expensive, and I wanted to find a way to expand my learning
							of PLC programming (and utilize test projects) without breaking the bank.
							OpenPLC is an open-source PLC programming software that can run on a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,
							or just your own PC, and FactoryIO is a virtual plant software that can simulate a plant
							environment (which you can get a free trial for 30 days).
							Together, they can be used to learn PLC programming and simulate a plant environment for
							free (for 30 days, then about $20/month for FactoryIO).
							This is my demo of how to get these to work together using the Modus communication protocol
							as a link.

							<p>TAGS: electronics; automation; industrial; PLC;

						</header>
						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							One of the possible careers paths I wanted to branch into was Automation. I had previous
							history with industrial operations,
							so using industrial automation controls (dubbed Operational Technology) and using PLC
							(programmable logic controllers) systems;
							but less familiar with the programming side of it (I only 'heard' of Ladder logic and
							function block programming). <br>
							NAIT offered courses in PLC programming, and I wanted to learn more about it. I took the PLC
							Ladder Logic Programming and PLC Advanced Programming courses
							where I learned to program in the different IEC 61131-3 languages (Ladder Logic, Function
							Block Diagram, Structured Text, Sequential Function Chart,
							but not Instruction List as lots of companies consider it too archaic). I also learned to
							program Allen Bradley CompactLogix PLCs using the RSLogix 500 and Studio 5000 software.

							<h2><a href="Unbricking-My-Android-TV-Box.html">Nightmare electronics: Hard bricking my
									Android TV box then spending days to finally get it re-flashed alive.</a></h2>
							<p>TAGS: electronics; software; Linux Armbian Debian; RK3318 Android TV box; un-bricking;
								factory firmware flashing; maskrom boot mode;
							</p>
						</header>
						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							I had an Android TV box that was previously used to turn my old TV into a smart TV (with
							internet access and external hard drive access), but I had bought a cheap TV that had smart
							capabilities, and this box was slow and always ran hot, so it was pretty much useless as is.
							I wanted to see if I could test my electronics skills by repurposing this Android box with
							something new. I found online that some people built a Linux distro specifically for these
							ARM based systems, called Armbian (based on Debian), and, further, made a sub-distro for
							these Android TV boxes, called RK3318 Box (the chipset that I have).<br><br>
							I was able to install the system quite easily following the tutorial, and it dramatically
							reduced the temperature of the chip (before it was scalding hot), but I wanted to see if I
							could then install a Lakka gaming OS firmware; but something went wrong with the install and
							my box became totally unresponsive (bricked). I spent the next few days going over tutorials
							and forums of people who have unbricked these before by using factory firmware tools (with
							an unconventional USB A male to male cord), and grounding some of the board’s terminals, in
							order to get the board into maskrom mode, in which then its able to be communicated with and
							flashed with factory firmware. The factory firmware then allows a jumping point for which I
							can then flash the system via USB sticks of preload firmware of custom Linux
							software.<br><br>
							With a lot of patience, I finally got it to connect and flash, after which I pledged to not
							attempt that Lakka install again, but instead try something else.

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>I wanted to experience owning a solar storage system. I had the opportunity to receive
							some
							free 12V batteries, and I found a cheap basic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) solar
							charge controller and 50W solar panel online.
							The system totalled about $100. I also have a cheap 12V inverter (used in vehicles to
							get a
							120V AC supply).

						<p>Hackathons are great place to: brainstorm project ideas; meet other innovators; get some

						<p>I had a cheap Raspberry Pi 3B and learned they were capable of hosting web servers. I was

							Cloud based web servers aren’t free (for the most part; you can get an exception to this by
							using GitHub Pages, but apparently the level of service is limited); the costs arise from
							the power and service time allocated from companies to have their computers serve the cloud
							requests (think of it like charging for virtual parking and virtual valets of your website
							or other internet services). To get around this (at least at the individual tinkerers’
							level) you can host your own website on your own hardware.

									Embedded Systems Concepts
									With Arduino And FreeRTOS</a></h2>
							<p>TAGS: electronics; software; FreeRTOS; Arduino; nano; stepper motor; UART; </p>
						</header>
						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							In one of my university’s courses, we learned about real-time embedded systems.
							Real-time
							operating systems are systems that strive to complete tasks within hard time limits;
							these
							can be both scheduled and interrupt triggered tasks. They are important systems
							because not
							only do they express high performance with their ability to respond, but they are
							suitable
							for mission or safety critical systems (like vehicle accident black boxes, aircraft
							systems,
							medical devices).<br>
							FreeRTOS is an example of a real-time operating system (it’s in the name). I learned
							that
							you could import the FreeRTOS library on the Arduino IDE, so I wanted to reflect on
							the
							concepts in learned in my course and how I could apply them to an Arduino
							project.<br>
							The main concepts our course focused on were: multi-tasking/concurrency and
							priorities;
							queue containers; UART and SPI communications; device control (motors with
							opto-isolator,
							displays, buttons, leds); hardware interrupts and polling;
