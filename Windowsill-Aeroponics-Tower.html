						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							I’m grow greens in my hydroponics bin on a desk near my window, but the hydroponics box
							doesn’t hug the window as much as I like (it doesn’t utilize the available window space). I
							learned about these aeroponics towers and love the idea that they can be freely 3D printed
							and they utilize cramped spaces (perfect for urban farming). This also can be a good trial
							test for finding info for my university club’s greenhouse (to possibly utilize space in
							there).

						<div class="center">
							<p><i>I had a bunch of old filaments, hence the different colours.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p><b>Parts:</b> 3D printer (and, optionally, modeling software, like Fusion 360, for modifying
							prints); small water pump (at around 3.3V for my height tested) and hose; water reservoir
							with nutrients</p>

						<p>I really only followed the review of Brian’s YouTube video to see the ins and outs of the
							system; it was very well described.</p>

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<p><b>3D printing and modeling to fill in the gaps.</b> I had a small container that could fully
							sit on
							the windowsill and wanted to use that as the reservoir, but it didn’t natively fit with
							aeroponics tower, so thankfully the tower’s 3D files had included STEP files which are meant
							to be semi-universal workable models across different modeling applications. I was using
							Fusion360 and was able to modify one of the files to include the circular base locking
							mechanism overtop a rectangular platform so I could lock the tower on top the container.<br>
							<b>3D printing will take a looooong time.</b> It took about 8hrs to print the 2-way section
							of the tower, so making 8 or more of those will take a long time (and lot of printer
							filament). A viable alternative could be to buy a 4.5” diameter PVC pipe and fit holes along
							it (a heat gun could also help shape the holes to better contour a slope for holding plants
							and catch the dripping water). The 3D printed models could just be a guide on what parts you
							would need for a PVC setup.<br>
							<b>Good seedling growing techniques are necessary to maximize these systems.</b> I found you
							cannot ideally put small seedlings (or seeds) into this system without first growing them in
							a separate hot medium that isn’t constantly being run over with water, otherwise they rot.
							They need to under a lamp growing until like ‘finger’-size then moved to the tower with a
							rockwool, coco coir, grow sponge, or peatmoss medium. <br>
