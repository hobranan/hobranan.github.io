						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							I had an Android TV box that was previously used to turn my old TV into a smart TV (with
							internet access and external hard drive access), but I had bought a cheap TV that had smart
							capabilities, and this box was slow and always ran hot, so it was pretty much useless as is.
							I wanted to see if I could test my electronics skills by repurposing this android box with
							something new. I found online that some people built a Linux distro specifically for these
							ARM based systems, called Armbian (based on Debian), and, further, made a sub-distro for
							these Android TV boxes, called RK3318 Box (the chipset that I have).<br><br>
							I was able to install the system quite easily following the tutorial, and it dramatically
							reduced the temperature of the chip (before it was scalding hot), but I wanted to see if I
							could then install a Lakka gaming OS firmware; but something went wrong with the install and
							my box became totally unresponsive (bricked). I spent the next few days going over tutorials
							and forums of people who have unbricked these before by using factory firmware tools (with
							an unconventional USB A male to male cord), and grounding some of the board’s terminals, in
							order to get the board into maskrom mode, in which then its able to be communicated with and
							flashed with factory firmware. The factory firmware then allows a jumping point for which I
							can then flash the system via USB sticks of preload firmware of custom Linux
							software.<br><br>
							With a lot of patience, I finally got it to connect and flash, after which I pledged to not
							attempt that Lakka install again, but instead try something else.

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Was it worth it?</b>
							Probably not, but I
							suppose it felt good to triumph over adversity and repurpose a useless board. I think this
							experience taught me that with electronics there is usually always a way to unbrick them,
							and got me to experience the electronics systems at different levels of abstraction (first
							at OS/programing level, to then architectural/hardware level). The board is only worth like
							$40 bucks, so I don’t think I would spend much further time on it if it failed; it was
							really just a ‘can I fix it’ trial; I suppose this trial helped me think about the
							importance of researching good ‘all around compatible’ boards so that repurposing them in
							the future is easier.
