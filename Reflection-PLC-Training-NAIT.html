							<h2>Reflecting on PLC Training at NAIT: Earning my credentials of PLC Ladder Logic Programming and PLC Advanced Programming.</h2>
							<p>TAGS: electronics; automation; industrial; PLC;  </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>One of the possible careers paths I wanted to branch into was Automation. I had previous history with industrial operations, 
							so using industrial automation controls (dubbed Operational Technology) and using PLC (programmable logic controllers) systems; 
							but less familiar with the programming side of it (I only 'heard' of Ladder logic and function block programming). <br>
							NAIT offered courses in PLC programming, and I wanted to learn more about it. I took the PLC Ladder Logic Programming and PLC Advanced Programming courses
							where I learned to program in the different IEC 61131-3 languages (Ladder Logic, Function Block Diagram, Structured Text, Sequential Function Chart, 
							but not Instruction List as lots of companies consider it too archaic). I also learned to program Allen Bradley CompactLogix PLCs using the RSLogix 500 and Studio 5000 software.

						<h3>Course Highlights</h3>
						<!-- <p><b>Parts:</b> plotly software</p> -->

						<p>- We learned about the general components of a PLC like the power unit, the CPU card, communication cards (like Ethernet), and the various I/O cards like Digital Inputs, Digital Outputs, Analog Inputs, and Analog Outputs.<br>
							- We learned to connect with PLCs using the RSLinx software, which allows our editor (RSLogix 500) to connect via IP address to an available PLC set.<br>
							- We learned to connect with virtual plant software FactoryIO which can utlize our PLCs to act as virtual plants with sensors and actuators, so we can virtually test our PLC programming with realtime response.<br>
							- We developed in the Ladder logic language with extensive understanding of the scan cycle (gather inputs, scan from top to botom rungs for states, set outputs) 
							and fundamental components (like tag making, contacts, coils, latches, comparators, timers, counters, subroutines, etc.). <br>
							- We developed with more advanced components like the Oneshot, bitwise Move, and Forced bits for troubleshooting, and inplace live editing/updating.<br>:
							- Advancing from the RSLogix 500 to Studio 5000 (much better and can do more than just Ladder), we learned of fundamental PLC components in the Function Block Diagram, Seuqential Function Chart, and Structured Text languages.<br>
							- Beyond virtual FactoryIO scenarios, we practiced with physical PLC trainer setups (with physical buttons, switches, dials, LEDs, and value monitors).<br>
							- This extended to inter-PLC communications (and SCADA and communication understandings like Modbus, Ethernet) with programs that incorporated messaging and Sender/Receiver tags.<br>
							- The communication teachings included using terminal 'pings' and free Wireshark software to capture network communication.<br>
							- Overall, I learned immensely about PLC programming and the industrial automation field, and I'm excited to see where I can apply this knowledge in the future.
