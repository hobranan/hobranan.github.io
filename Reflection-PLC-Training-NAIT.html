							<h2>Reflecting on PLC Training at NAIT: Earning my credentials of PLC Ladder Logic
								Programming and PLC Advanced Programming.</h2>
							<p>TAGS: electronics; automation; industrial; PLC; Allen Bradley MicroLogix, CompactLogix,
								ControlLogix; Ladder; Function Block; Sequential Function Diagram; Structured Text</p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>One of the possible careers paths I wanted to branch into was Automation. I had previous
							history with industrial operations,
							so using industrial automation controls (dubbed Operational Technology) and using PLC
							(programmable logic controllers) systems;
							but less familiar with the programming side of it (I only 'heard' of Ladder logic and
							function block programming). <br>
							NAIT offered courses in PLC programming, and I wanted to learn more about it. I took the PLC
							Ladder Logic Programming and PLC Advanced Programming courses
							where I learned to program in the different IEC 61131-3 languages (Ladder Logic, Function
							Block Diagram, Structured Text, Sequential Function Chart,
							but not Instruction List as lots of companies consider it too archaic). I also learned to
							program Allen Bradley MicroLogix 1100 controllers using RSLogix 500 software; and then
							CompactLogix 1769-L24ER controllers and 1756-L71 ControlLogix Logix5571
							controllers using Studio 5000 Logix Designer.<br>
							We also did some short programming/training on a microsystems SCADAPack32 remote terminal
							unit (RTU) when we were
							learning of
							different communications protocol/methods, but these were slower systems so the training was
							minimally covered.

							<p><i>Our training was with using Allen Bradley's PLCs (MicroLogix, CompactLogix,
									ControlLogix); very
									popular industrial
									PLCs.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Course Highlights</h3>
						<!-- <p><b>Parts:</b> plotly software</p> -->

						<p>- We learned about the general components of a PLC like the power unit, the CPU card,
							communication cards (like Ethernet), and the various I/O cards like Digital Inputs, Digital
							Outputs, Analog Inputs, and Analog Outputs.<br>
							- We learned to connect with PLCs using the RSLinx software, which allows our editor
							(RSLogix 500 and Studio 5000) to connect via IP address to an available PLC set.<br>
							- We learned to connect with virtual plant software FactoryIO which can utlize our PLCs to
							act as virtual plants with sensors and actuators, so we can virtually test our PLC
							programming with realtime response.<br>
							- We developed in the Ladder logic language with extensive understanding of the scan cycle
							(gather inputs, scan from top to botom rungs for states, set outputs)
							and fundamental components (like tag making, contacts, coils, latches, comparators, timers,
							counters, subroutines, etc.). <br>
							- We developed with more advanced components like the Oneshot, bitwise Move, and Forced bits
							for troubleshooting, and online live editing/updating.<br>
							- We also delved into the status, error, and performance aspects where you can view the
							fault/error codes and how to reset them, and the scan performance times.<br>
							- Advancing from the RSLogix 500 to Studio 5000 (much better and can do more than just
							Ladder), we learned of fundamental PLC components in the Function Block Diagram, Seuqential
							Function Chart, and Structured Text languages.<br>
							- Beyond virtual FactoryIO scenarios, we practiced with physical PLC trainer setups (with
							physical buttons, switches, dials, LEDs, and value monitors).<br>
							- This extended to inter-PLC communications (and SCADA and communication understandings like
							Modbus, Ethernet) with programs that incorporated messaging and Sender/Receiver tags.<br>
							- The communication teachings included using terminal 'pings' and free Wireshark software to
							capture network communication.<br>
							- Overall, I learned immensely about PLC programming and the industrial automation field,
							and I'm excited to see where I can apply this knowledge in the future.

							<p><i>Our initial training was to remotely control some MicroLogix 1100 PLCs using RSLinx,
									which would then actuate virtual plant equipment hosted on FactoryIO (virtual plant
									software). We would use RSLogix 500 to made Ladder programs to control the PLCs and
									virtual scenes.</i>

							<p><i>Here we experienced 'oneshot' controlling (ONS) that would do a calculation only once
									if the red light turned one. We also exeperience online live editing of programming
									(the 'e' and 'r' seen near the rung numbering) which allowed us to change the PLC
									program without shutdown and reuploading.</i>

							<p><i>We also learned about monitoring and resetting fault/error detections, forcing bits
									(manual overriding of states; seen with the yellow box "Forces Enabled"), and
									checking PLC
									performance through scan cycle times (not shown, but you can see the "Scan Times"
									tab).</i>

								<p><i>On later lessons we switched to Studio 5000 Logix Designer which was much more
										user friendly at programming compared to the 500 (aside from now being able to
										use languages other than Ladder).</i>

								<p><i>A Studio 5000 program written in the very popular Function Block Diagram language.
										Using our station's PLC trainer, we could assign alarm states to the LED outputs
										(plain-on and blinking states), and dial inputs to scaled values. In this
										program, I take the analog dial input from my PLC trainer and scale it to a
										value between 0 and 300, sending it to a LT_97 message variable/tag; I also
										recieve a different LT_99 message tag from my teacher's PLC which feeds into
										comparison blocks of less than (LES), limit-within (LIM), and greater-than
										(GRT) along with setpoint variables to determine alarm states (low, high,
										high-high). The low alarm turns on a specific light, while the high alarm turns
										on another light, and the high-high alarm blinks the 'high' light (using two
										Timer blocks).<br>
										Our teacher's PLC messages us the values of: the alarm setpoints, the LT_99
										value, and
										commands to reset a counter (utilized through an Equal block going to a reset
										pin); while we send to our teacher messages of: our dial
										0-300 output, our alarm states, and a count of the alarms (using a Counter
										block).</i>

								<p><i>We were shown how to setup Ethernet links to other PLCs in our local network
										(through IP addresses and Ethernet/IP protocol), and then assigning
										variables/tags messages corresponding to those other PLCs. We learned of the
										passive messaging style of producer and consumer tags (seen in the above 2
										photos), but also of explicit messaging though messaging functions blocks. </i>

								<p><i>We touched on Schneider's SCADAPack 32 remote terminal unit (RTU) and the
										development software 'Workbench'. We didn't explore much from it as it was much
										slower to program with than compared to the AB's PLCs. It did have the ability
										to program in
										the different IEC languages.</i>
