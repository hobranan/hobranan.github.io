							<h2>Testing LoRa Communication Using My TTGO LoRa ESP32 Microcontrollers, Smartphones, And
								The Meshtastic App</h2>
							<p>TAGS: electronics; nature projects; TTGO Esp32 LoRa; Meshtastic app; smartphone;
								Bluetooth; </p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							Wanted to experience the impressive long-range (LoRa) abilities of the TTGO esp32 LoRa
							technology.
							I figured a perfect use for pair of these is a messaging network that doesn’t use cellular
							nor WAN-wifi service
							(like if I’m hiking in deep woods); I would program the LoRa esps to each pair with separate
							smartphones
							(via wifi access points or Bluetooth), then use the LoRas to communicate with each other
							over long distance;
							The smartphones could then send messages to each other through their LoRa counterparts. <br>
							But… it turns out someone already made that!<br>
							The Meshtastic project is an open-source project design to build mesh communication networks
							using low powered devices.

							<p><i>A single user setup (of LoRa controller, smartphone, and battery pack for the LoRa)
									which we shall designate as "Me1" or "1".<br>This user communicates with another
									user called "Me2" or "2" on the
									same channel feed. </i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p><b>Parts:</b> 2x TTGO esp32 LoRa; 2x smartphone (with Meshtastic app and Bluetooth); 2x
							batteries</p>
						<p>Following the directions of the Meshtastic webpage: I installed the USB to esp32 drivers (for
							allowing the
							computer to talk to the devices), then installed the Meshtastic firmware to the
							microcontrollers, via computer.
							I then installed the android version of the Meshtastic app to both of my smartphones (via
							Android Play Store).
							Then I paired a smartphone to an esp32 device (via the app’s Bluetooth connection software)
							and repeated for
							the other esp and smartphone. After changing the settings to be on the US band (which is
							915MHz; my model),
							and changing device recognition names, I was able to get both pairs of systems to talk to
							each other. Success!

							<p><i>This second user "Me2" or "2" has a similar separate LoRa setup, and is replying to
									the first user.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>How well does it perform?</b> It works but I have yet to test the distance it can work from.
						I will need to update this article when I go climbs some mountains. <br>
						<b>Nice compartment needed.</b> I used an old 3d printed casing for each device, but they aren’t
						good enough; I need one ready for nature’s elements.<br>
						<b>Good app, but it could be more.</b> LoRa is known for its long-distance information transfer,
						but I believe it lacks in bandwidth (can only do small data packets); nevertheless, if it was
						programmed, I believe it could send small data voice messages instead of being limited to just
						text messages. Could be a good potential update for the app (or building my own version of the app).
