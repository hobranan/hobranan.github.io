						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>I wanted to experience owning a solar storage system. I had the opportunity to receive some
							free 12V batteries, and I found a cheap basic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) solar
							charge controller and 50W solar panel online.
							The system totalled about $100. I also have a cheap 12V inverter (used in vehicles to get a
							120V AC supply).

									strung to the left through the wall). </i>

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p><b>Parts:</b> 50W solar panel; 12V batteries; MPPT; 12V terminal socket; 12V inverter</p>

						<p>I installed the panel on the south wall of my place (the location is practically perfect for
							sun capture, and the occasional rain keeps the panel clean). I combined my cheap 12V
							batteries
							(they were old emergency light batteries that were replaced, so I got them for free; they
							are garbage quality, but enough for me to experiment with solar setups and various load
							types). Finally, I hooked up the wiring between the panel, batteries, and my MPPT charge
							controller. I also installed the
							12V terminal socket and inverter to power 120V appliances (or optional 5V systems). Since I
							was using 16AWG speaker wire (which is not recommended for these setups), I added some 5A
							fuses (the wires could apparently handle 10A, but for the sake of my setup I stuck with 5A).

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>Go Pro.</b> I only bought the items because they were cheap, and I just wanted to experience
						a solar storage system (because I’m an engineer and very interested in sustainable systems), but
						this system is currently not professionally set up. It needs code-acceptable wiring, a quality
						battery, some grommets for the wall wiring, and a lot more solar wattage to be useful for high
						power loads.
						However, the MPPT was less than $20 (when I bought it) and it is surprisingly great quality
						(lots of features and control for cheap price).<br>
						<b>Every little bit helps… I think.</b> Even though it’s a cheap setup, it can be used for my
						hydroponics’ system; the plant water container needs a constant bubbling of air to prevent mold
						growth on roots. The bubbler’s wattage is so low
						that this solar system could kept it powered indefinitely (even with its poor batteries, and
						periods of low sunshine). It's
						not saving me money, but it does make it an uninterrupted power spply.
