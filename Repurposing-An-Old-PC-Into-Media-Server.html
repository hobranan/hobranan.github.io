							<h2>Repurposing An Old PC Into A Media Server</h2>
							<p>TAGS: software; operating system OS; TrueNAS; OpenMediaVault; Docker; Linux Ubuntu with
								Jellyfin
							</p>
						</header>

						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							I had an old (really old Windows Vista) PC that was collecting dust, so I wanted to see if I
							could use it as a NAS storage server (just to increase my knowledge of it), or something
							else like a Linux distro.
						</p>

						<span class="image featured"><img
							src="articleAssets\Repurposing-An-Old-PC-Into-Media-Server\repurpose_old_PC_2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<div class="center">
								<p><i>Ubuntu is what Linux distro I settled with.</i>
								</p>
							</div>

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p><b>Parts:</b> Old PC, media server software (tried TrueNAS, OpenMediaVault, Docker, Linux
							Ubuntu with server apps like Jellyfin)</p>

						<p>
							I tried various tutorials with various separate attempts to install and setup the basic OS
							of TrueNAS or OpenMediaVault, even through a Docker container system; I was failing those
							attempts because of hardware limitations so I then tried installing the Ubuntu OS with then
							trying to install media server applications like Jellyfin (see references below for those
							tutorials).
						</p>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p>
							TrueNAS needs 2+ hard drives. It wasn’t clear at first but became apparent when I could not
							see any available drives after installing. If I had a small 16GB drive I could dedicate that
							to the OS, and use my present 500GB drive for storage. Apparently I can also use a USB
							stick, but that it’s prone to burning out as it being use as the main OS gateway device
							(also short-term testing showed that the OS is very slow from it).<br><br>

							Docker would be great to allow multiple containers for multiple different servers, buuuuut…
							My PC is so old that it’s hardware cannot support virtualization capabilities; I get an
							error saying I lack KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) capabilities. I could still
							install each OS, but I couldn’t install Docker to further install containers. However, I
							could still install a Cloudflare tunnel through the shell CURL method (which is the only
							thing I really care about for this test).<br><br>

							OpenMediaVault seemed to work ok locally, but that is pointless for me. I managed to set it
							up with a drive that I can see and share on my local network, but I wanted to have this
							media server accessible from the public WAN. I couldn’t seem to get the Cloudflare tunnel to
							function (not sure why and am not willing to router port forward; maybe I’m not
							knowledgeable enough on this setup).<br><br>

							Ubuntu with Jellyfin is what I settled with. I was able to setup Ubuntu, Jellyfin, and a
							Cloudflare tunnel successfully with this setup. This is fine because it can display media
							(mp4 and mp3, but jpg wasn’t showing), and I can still keep Ubuntu OS so that I can add more
							apps and more servers in future project endeavours. If I were to be serious at a true NAS
							development, then I would probably get some more disk drives and try one of the previous OS
							based options again.
