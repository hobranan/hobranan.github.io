						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							It was the project of one of my engineering courses where the focus was to learn some
							Arduino electronics building
							and to learn how to brainstorm and report projects (for imaginary customers). We were tasked
							with building a wind
							speed sensor (turbine) using a rotary encoder and Arduino, plus 2 additional sensors of our
							choice (I chose temperature and humidity). I was able to work on my coding skills through
							Arduino programming. I also was able to
							build on my Fusion 360 3D modeling and printing skills by printing some wind blades and
							housings. Finally, we had
							to summarize our project into a report PDF.

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p>I won’t go into too much textual detail here because I made a link to 3-minute video
							showcasing the project, and I have linked the project pdf report. <br>

							Project summary report (includes 3D models and Arduino code): <br>

							Given that this was done during the 2020 pandemic (so everyone’s isolated with virtual group
							meetings),
							and I was the self-appointed leader of the project (with the most experience with 3D
							modeling,
							Arduino electronics, and reports), I would confidently say I did more than 90% of the
							project myself.

									values.</i>

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>Reports are a nice tool.</b> I did the project a few years ago,
						so I forgot the material since then, but the report I made certainly jogs my memory
						as to what work I had to do to build this system.
						<b>I think the weather system actually works.</b> I remember distinctly during a period when
						collecting the temperature values (for calibration) that I noticed the system temperature was
						dropping, humidity was
						rising, and the wind average was getting higher; I thought to myself "I wonder if a storm is
						coming?"... Low and behold, within 20 minutes the area was covered in dark clouds and rain, so
						maybe thing actually works?! HaHa.
