						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							On a previous test, I had repurposed my old PC into something new (and hopefully useful); I
							could only manage to get Ubuntu installed which seem to make the system run relatively well
							(but not fast). I wanted to extend the repurposing of the PC, and build some experience with
							Linux servers by trying to make an internet radio server on the PC. I heard about Icecast, a
							free internet server system, so decided to install it and use free Mixx DJ software to
							broadcast music (I could also just copy songs to a folder readable by Icecast but I just
							chose this route).

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p><b>Parts:</b> Old PC (to host server); Linux Ubuntu; Icecast radio server; Mixx DJ software;
							Cloudflare tunneling service</p>
						<p>
							I followed Kurt Edelbrock’s and Vultr’s tutorials which were to basically just use a Linux
							command line install of icecast onto my old host PC, then edit the Icecast configuration
							files to configure the server address and port. I then used Cloudflare tunnelling to convert
							those addresses to a DNS style website (radio.branhoy.com) so that I could access the server
							from any browser or music playing app that allows for http entries. I also downloaded Mixx
							DJing software to test out live music mixing and broadcasting (it was a program that was
							already compatible with Icecast as an output medium), then tested the setup from my phone.

							<p><i>The broadcast on my phone via browser; I can also listen from the address via music
									player app, like VLC.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p>
							Everything seemed work but my old PC is way too slow for basic tasks. The radio server setup
							well and was able to broadcast songs, but because of the slow PC, it was choppy playing
							(like even on the PC itself, if the PC was better I would assume the broadcasting would have
							been fine); I think I might need to
							recycle this computer as its uses are realizing to be none.<br>
							This trial was just another test to play with servers and repurposing computers, so I don’t
							know if I'd ever practically use this again, it might be easier to find some online free
							server to hold my tracks, though if I ever wanted to do any live dj-ing, I could use this.
