						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>I had a cheap Raspberry Pi 3B and learned they were capable of hosting web servers. I was
							learning more about web servers and figured this would be a good pi project; additionally, I
							figured this project might teach me more about the intricacies of non-cloud web servers.<br>

							Cloud based web servers aren’t free (for the most part; you can get an exception to this by
							using GitHub Pages, but apparently the level of service is limited); the costs arise from
							the power and service time allocated from companies to have their computers serve the cloud
							requests (think of it like charging for virtual parking and virtual valets of your website
							or other internet services). To get around this (at least at the individual tinkerers’
							level) you can host your own website on your own hardware.

							<p><i>Simple and free (if you have a spare Pi), but is it safe?.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p><b>Parts:</b> Raspberry Pi 3B; html template packaged files (free from Html5up); optional
							domain name (for $13/year from Namecheap, or $6/year with first time buyer’s coupon); Nginx
							server software</p>

						<p>I had to follow quite a few different tutorials to get a website working (see references
							below), but basically:<br>
							- I installed a Raspberry Pi OS on my pi, added login credentials, turned on SSH, and
							accessed the pi (through either plugged keyboard and monitor, or, via SSH through VSCode
							editor).<br>
							- I installed Nginx via shell ‘sudo apt install’, then started the service.<br>
							- I uploaded some test html files (from HTML5UP) to the nginx html host folders.<br>
							- I setup free SSL connection using a Let's Encrypt plugin.
							- I set my router to forward ports to allow http and https connections (and I also have a
							domain name from Namecheap that I used to act as my website name instead of my public IP
							address).

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>Good, albeit limited performance.</b> If you expect to use this server only for low traffic
						projects, then this Pi hardware is fine, but fi you expect to host your fast-growing web store
						form it then I would use a cloud service or dedicate a faster processing computer.
						<b>Beware of power outages.</b> If the server is needed for intermittent usage, then Pi is fine
						alone, but if its need for a constant service, like 24/7 data tracker or controller, then you
						might need to install some sort of uninterrupted power supply.
						<b>Exposed?</b> In order to keep this server public, I had to open my ports; I have a domain
						name to
						use instead of an IP address, but anyone can easily find out what that IP is with IP look ups.
						Apparently, this is not a very secure method as I’m more exposed to hacker attacks (if they can
						target my server with program vulnerability packets). A way to increase security is to hide my
						IP by using a proxy service like Cloudflare (this way when people look for my IP they get
						Cloudflare’s instead), and, to use intermediate server tunneling agents, as installed programs, on my
						server’s computer so I don’t have to expose any ports (like installing Cloudflare Zero Trust,
						Astrorelay, etc. so my pi is talking to cloud flares server which then talks to the open world,
						without my IP and port configurations).
