						<h3>Why I Did This</h3>
						<p>
							I have a garden, old irrigation supplies, rain collection barrels, and wanted to see if I
							could apply my computer skills into creating an automated watering system.<br>
							I am hoping this system might develop to be an acceptable system for watering my plants if
							I'm away for like a week.
						</p>

									A blue 120V cord receives power, while a yellow cord is powering the irrigation pump
									via single relay.</i>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Design Walkthrough</h3>
						<p><b>Parts:</b> esp8266; 4 channel relay; 1 channel relay; 12V water solenoids;
							45W 120V water fountain pump; water hoses and spouts; various-leveled power supplies and
							wiring; rain barrels</p>

						<p>For an initial evaluation setup, I wanted to create a system where my water pump would supply
							collected rainwater to up-to
							4 garden bed areas using an esp microcontroller controlling the solenoid valves at timed
							intervals. I installed old water
							hoses in three of the bed areas and connected them to the solenoids using tie-straps (since
							I didn’t have reducers);
							strung the supply hose to the water pump sitting in a rain barrel; wired 18awg wire to the
							12V solenoids and relays;
							cut and tied an extension cord to the single 120V relay; wired the 5V and 12V supply
							adapters; then wired the 5V signal wires to the esp controller.
							I programmed the esp (using Arduino IDE) to open the solenoids, one at a time, for 5 minutes
							each, then observed the irrigation performance.

						<h3>Lessons Learned and Future Changes</h3>
						<b>Go Pro.</b> I wanted to see how the system would work with what spare parts I already had
						(aside from the $30 12V 4 channel solenoid I bought). The system works, but only ok in some
						areas; the flow is not very high, and the hoses need more positioned spouts. The wires should be
						up to code specs (the current wires are ok for supervised usage, but I’m not comfortable leaving
						it run alone), and could probably benefit from some fuses. The rain coverings are just old
						tupperware
						containers, so, I could 3D print some properly fitted ABS containers. <br>
						<b>It plugs too easily.</b> The rain barrel seems to collect silt and grow algae and that gets
						sucked into the pump, and the solenoid piece has a fine mesh screen to hold back junk so as to
						retain better seating of the valves; that screen plugs very quickly if the barrel experiences
						any
						turbulence. I wonder if I could 3D print an inline filter to help that mesh perform longer? <br>
						<b>Easier monitoring wanted.</b> Right now, the code is just simple relay timer scripts, but it
						would be nice to add this system to an online server where I could program schedules; maybe I
						will program that manually or find an MQTT service that can do that.
						</p>
						<b>UPDATE: 3D printed component box.</b> I found a nice customizable box by 'Bruners_' on
						Thingiverse. It's quite large for a 3D printed item (about 20cm x 20cm x 10cm), but is still too
						small/snug of a fit for the components; it barely fits everything in there.
						We will have to see how water-resistant it is; if it isn't very water resistant, then maybe I
						can coat the box with some PVC glue (which is basically PVC chips dissolved in acetone).
						Otherwise, it looks much better than before (when it was poorly covered by a plastic bin).
